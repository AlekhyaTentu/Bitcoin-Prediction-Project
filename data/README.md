### How to Use These Files

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Both `bitcoin_data_5_years.csv` and `bitcoin_articles.csv` are essential to the project. Youâ€™ll need to place them in the `data/` directory in the repository.
   - For Wikipedia data, once we include it in the project, you can download and use the `wikipedia_edits.csv` file to analyze sentiment from Wikipedia revisions.
   
2. **Integration**: These datasets are merged based on the `Date` column to combine Bitcoin price information with sentiment analysis data from the news articles and Wikipedia edits.

3. **Usage in Scripts**: The data files are read into the Python environment using `pandas`, where preprocessing and analysis are performed for machine learning model training and evaluation.
